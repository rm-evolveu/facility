Check the scenario with updating population of non-existing cities
Check all strings and exception handling
Check file names and paths

>> Deployment:
- Ensure you update cities.db location
- Ensure you update backend host in CityComponent.js
>> Deployment:

- Decide if to differentiate exceptions and row_count with different status codes in the backend
- What should the 'message' be when row_count is 0

- Make messages more intuitive (could not pandemize)

- Chrome load page from cache on restart, so radio button is wrong
- Opera OK

- Please build backend routes in frontend in a smarter way than
- http://' + hostName + '/api/ddb/all

- Do we need to check the uniqueness of uuid4()

- Do we want to delete old api?
